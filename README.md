Query-Based Description Extraction and Ranking from PDF Files
This project involves a comprehensive approach to extracting and ranking descriptions from PDF files based on query relevance. Utilizing pdfplumber, the project extracts text from multiple PDFs, treating each line as an individual description. The extracted descriptions are then ranked using the Cross-Encoder Ranking approach, leveraging the jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual model, a Large Language Model (LLM), to evaluate their relevance to a specified query. The process includes query-based filtering to refine the results by removing irrelevant content and applying a relevance threshold with keyword checks. The final output displays ranked descriptions along with their scores, facilitating the identification of the most pertinent information based on the query. This method enhances the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval from PDF documents, ensuring high-quality results for user queries.
